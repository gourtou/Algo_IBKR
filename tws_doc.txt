TWS configuration settings
1) Enable ActiveX Socket Clients - must be enabled to allow the TWS to accept API connections.
2) Read-Only API: Uncheck this as sending orders to the TWS require write access.
3) Socket Port: Set to 7496 for regular brokerage accounts and 7497 for paper trading accounts.
4) Logging Level: Set to "Detail" as this records all program logs that can be used for future reference or debugging.
5) Allow Connections from localhost only (if using the localhost to send requests).
    Change this later if access from an external or virtual machine.
